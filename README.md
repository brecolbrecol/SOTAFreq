SOTA frequencies assigment

This repo:

1. Generates a summits map (kml & index.html), showing each reference associated with activators and freq.
1. Tries to solve the problem of several concurrent in time line of sight (LOS) VHF activations, proposing free frequencies for each activator.
1. Generates a summit to summit distance & bearing file.

## Available frequencies

We propose leaving free 145.500 (calling frequency) so any amateur radio operator, activity participant or not, could use it as meeting point.

It would be great having a list of known local used frequencies for each zone.
